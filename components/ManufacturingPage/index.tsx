          <p>
            In the initial stage at our research centre, we develop the
            formulations; process them till they are stable and ready for
            commercialization. We also have tie-up with contract manufacturers.
            The further production takes place in the very presence of our
            scientists and skilled technicians. This ensures the best quality
            for every single product that we bring out in the market.
            <br /> <br />
            Also maxcess Pharma is going to prepare its new plant in a short
            period of time, which will be able to create new products with
            advanced laboratory facilities and research.
